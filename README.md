# Low-latency Audio Driver

This project includes a new USB Audio Class 2 (UAC2) driver, optimized for low-latency musician scenarios. It also includes an ASIO interface to the UAC2 driver to support applications which use the ASIO standard. This driver, and its supporting components, will be shipped in Windows.

> There is no public release of the driver, yet. **This section will be updated with the Windows Insider Build information once the driver preview ships in Windows.**

This project is open source to enable community participation, and to encourage others to create and ship useful low-latency audio drivers for Windows. Microsoft has a license with Steinberg specifically for the use of ASIO in Windows, when shipped from/by Microsoft for Windows. This license does not transfer to individuals, companies, or organizations building this source code, or deriving other drivers from this source code. Please refer to the Steinberg ASIO SDK license for more information.

### Steinberg ASIO SDK

The projects in this repo require the Steinberg ASIO SDK to compile. Use of the source here does not grant any license for the Steinberg ASIO SDK. All contributors to the project, and anyone compiling from source, is required to have an agreement with Steinberg and obtain the ASIO SDK directly from them. 

In the case that asio SDK files are (incorrectly) included in a pull request or other location in this repo, they are excluded from the MIT license that governs this repo. Nothing in this repo shall be construed as impacting or modifying the Steinberg license agreement for the ASIO SDK.
